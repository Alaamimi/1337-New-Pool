### 1337 School
## Piscine C

This project is a programming bootcamp at 1337 school, it lasts roughly from 2 to 4 weeks, working 7 days a week, day and night.
These bootcamps cover the basics so there's no need to have any experience at
all. People will try and will fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error
process is necessary in order to find solutions to different problems that once thought
impossible. People learn in groups with other
students, without teachers. It can be done, and it works.
